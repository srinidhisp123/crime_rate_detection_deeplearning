Crime Rate Detection using Deep Learning Overview This project aims to predict and analyze crime rates using deep learning techniques. The implemented models include Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), Bidirectional GRU (BiGRU), and variations such as Bidirectional GRU with RNN (BiGRU RNN) and Bidirectional LSTM with RNN (BiLSTM RNN). The dataset used for training and evaluation consists of crime-related data, and the models are designed to capture temporal patterns in the data for accurate crime rate predictions.

Models LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory): A type of recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture designed to capture long-term dependencies in sequential data.

BiLSTM (Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory): Extends LSTM by processing input sequences in both forward and backward directions, enhancing the model's ability to capture context from both past and future information.

GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit): Similar to LSTM but with a simplified structure, making it computationally more efficient while still capable of capturing temporal dependencies.

BiGRU (Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit): Applies the bidirectional approach to the GRU architecture, combining the benefits of capturing context from both directions.

BiGRU RNN (Bidirectional GRU with RNN): A hybrid model that combines bidirectional GRU with a traditional recurrent neural network for improved feature extraction.

BiLSTM RNN (Bidirectional LSTM with RNN): Integrates bidirectional LSTM with a traditional recurrent neural network, aiming to capture long-term dependencies and bidirectional context simultaneously.

Results The models were trained and evaluated on a comprehensive crime dataset, and their performance was assessed in terms of accuracy and prediction capabilities. The README provides instructions on how to replicate the experiments and analyze the results for each model.
